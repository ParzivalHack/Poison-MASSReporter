## Repository Repurposed

This repository has been **repurposed**.  
Originally, it contained a small experimental script with no real usage or community activity.  

As of 13/09/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY), the repository has been **reset and transformed** into a **new, professional project**: Pyspector, which is **completely different** from the original content.  

The star count and forks have been preserved for continuity, but please note that they refer to the old repository state.  

If you are here for **PySpector**, you are in the right place :)
  
The code, documentation, and roadmap you see now are **the new software**, actively maintained.  

Final note: some forks of this repository may still contain the old code, but they are unrelated to the current project.
