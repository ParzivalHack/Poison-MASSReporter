  commit: 422e93885b3c611234d602aa795f3d75a62cc93e
  date: 5 Dec 2023
  version: 3.0.0
  changes:
    - TODO - Some strikethrough and subscript combinations are not rendered
      correctly in markdown-it either, but that can be fixed at a later stage,
      perhaps in both markdown-it and markdown-it-py.
      See `tests/fixtures/subscript_strikethrough.md` for examples.
